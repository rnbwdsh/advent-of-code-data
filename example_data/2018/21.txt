The example you have given is not a valid input-output pair as it is a description of a problem rather than an example of input and output data. In order to provide an example of input and output data, you would need to specify the input data and the expected output for that input. For example, if you were trying to solve the problem of reversing a string, an example input-output pair could be "hello" and "olleh".

Here is an example of a json object that represents an input-output pair for the problem of reversing a string:

```
{
  "input": "hello",
  "output": "olleh"
}
```

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
