The input is a string with the name of a specific Aunt Sue followed by a list of things that the My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine can detect, and the output is the number of the Aunt Sue that gave you the gift. For example:

```
{
    "input": "Sue 1: children: 3, cats: 7, samoyeds: 2, pomeranians: 3, akitas: 0, vizslas: 0, goldfish: 5, trees: 3, cars: 2, perfumes: 1",
    "output": 1
}
```

Note that the input string has been right-trimmed to remove any unnecessary whitespace at the end.
