Here is an example of input data and the corresponding output:

```
{
  "input": "NNCB\nCH -> B\nHH -> N\nCB -> H\nNH -> C\nHB -> C\nHC -> B\nHN -> C\nNN -> C\nBH -> H\nNC -> B\nNB -> B\nBN -> B\nBB -> N\nBC -> B\nCC -> N\nCN -> C",
  "output": 1588
}
```

In this example, the input consists of the polymer template `NNCB` followed by the pair insertion rules. After 10 steps of pair insertion, the polymer has grown to length 3073, and the most and least common elements are B (1749 occurrences) and H (161 occurrences), respectively. Taking the quantity of the most common element and subtracting the quantity of the least common element gives 1749 - 161 = 1588, which is the output.
