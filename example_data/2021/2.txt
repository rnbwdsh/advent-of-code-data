Here is a valid example for the input data and output specified in the question:

```
{
    "input": "forward 5\ndown 5\nforward 8\nup 3\ndown 8\nforward 2\n",
    "output": 150
}
```

In this example, the input is a string that represents a series of commands for the submarine to execute. The output is the result of multiplying the final horizontal position by the final depth, as instructed in the prompt.

In this case, the submarine starts at a horizontal position of 0 and a depth of 0. When the submarine executes the series of commands specified in the input string, it ends up at a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 10, resulting in an output of 150 when the horizontal position and depth are multiplied together.
