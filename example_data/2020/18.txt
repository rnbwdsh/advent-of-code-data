Here is an example of the input and the corresponding output:

```
{
  "input": "1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6",
  "output": 71
}
```

The input is the string `"1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6"`, and the corresponding output is the number `71`. This is because the steps to evaluate the expression are as follows:

1. `1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6`
2. `3 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6`
3. `9 + 4 * 5 + 6`
4. `13 * 5 + 6`
5. `65 + 6`
6. `71`

Note that the input string has been right-trimmed, so any whitespace on the right side of the string has been removed.
