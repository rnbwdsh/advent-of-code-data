The example you provided is not a valid JSON object, but I will provide you with an example of a JSON object that satisfies the interface you specified.

Here is an example of a JSON object that satisfies the interface:

```
{
  "input": "0/2\n2/2\n2/3\n3/4\n3/5\n0/1\n10/1\n9/10",
  "output": 31
}
```

This JSON object represents the following example:

```
Input:
0/2
2/2
2/3
3/4
3/5
0/1
10/1
9/10

Output:
31
```

To obtain the output, we can build the bridge `0/1--10/1--9/10`, which has a strength of `0+1 + 1+10 + 10+9 = 31`.
