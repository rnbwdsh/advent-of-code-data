Here is an example of the input and output for this problem:

```
{
    "input": "R75,D30,R83,U83,L12,D49,R71,U7,L72U62,R66,U55,R34,D71,R55,D58,R83",
    "output": 159
}
```

In this example, the first wire's path is `R75,D30,R83,U83,L12,D49,R71,U7,L72` and the second wire's path is `U62,R66,U55,R34,D71,R55,D58,R83`. The wires intersect at two locations, but the lower-left intersection is closer to the central port, with a distance of `3 + 3 = 6`. The Manhattan distance from the central port to the closest intersection is therefore `159`.
