Here is an example of input data and the corresponding output, formatted as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "input": "109,1,204,-1,1001,100,1,100,1008,100,16,101,1006,101,0,99",
  "output": "109,1,204,-1,1001,100,1,100,1008,100,16,101,1006,101,0,99"
}
```

In this example, the input is a program for an Intcode computer that, when run in test mode with the input `1`, outputs a copy of itself. The output of the program when run with the input `1` is therefore the same as the input, `"109,1,204,-1,1001,100,1,100,1008,100,16,101,1006,101,0,99"`.
